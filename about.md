Thank you for stopping by! I am a SE Michigan native now living in the suburbs of Chicago with my wife, daughter and dog Raleigh. You can find me at the ice rink a few times a week playing hockey or occassionally dropping groovy bass lines. My favorite sports teams are Michigan Football and the Detroit Red Wings.

I am currently the CTO at Phoenix Sports, a holding company that invests in sports-focused technology companies with a specific focus toward the youth market. The role gives me a unique perspective in that I work with multiple CEOs across our portfolio on a daily basis and play a role in helping them create meaningful products that positively affect the lives of sports fans and athletes. Please follow me if you're interested in learning how to create great companies and products.
